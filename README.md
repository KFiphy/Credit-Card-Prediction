# Credit-Card-Prediction


In financial industry, the process of credit card approval plays a pivotal role in shaping the customer experience and managing risk. Traditional approaches to credit assessment have evolved, and the integration of machine learning techniques has emerged. This project embarks on the  implementation of machine learning models to predict credit card approvals, offering financial institutions a data-driven approach to decision-making. It aims to unravel the intricate patterns and variables that influence credit card approval outcomes. 
Based on the classification nature of the problem at hand, I plan to employ a diverse set of classifiers, including the Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier.
